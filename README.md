## What's Unique in this Project

- The Tweet Stream project uses Twitter Developer API extensively to set Tweet Fields, Get Rules, Set Rules, and Delete Rules
- The Express JS framework on top of Node JS Runtime gets the Tweet Stream by fetching them using Twitter Developer APIs
- Socket.io allows us to use web sockets to facilitate open door connection between client and server, and here the projects connects the client views with the node server
- The Microservice adds Tweets to the DOM dynamically
